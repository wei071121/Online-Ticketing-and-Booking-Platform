# Student Society & Event Ticketing Platform

A minimal PHP + MySQL CRUD web app for the **AMIT3253 Cloud Computing for Business**
capstone assignment. Students browse campus events (concerts, society nights,
talks), buy tickets against a live inventory count, and simulate paying for them.
Use this folder as-is as your Phase 2/3 starting point so you can focus on the AWS
infrastructure (VPC, EC2, RDS, ELB, ASG) instead of writing app code from scratch.

*Confirmation page — one QR code per ticket, generated client-side, for admin check-in.*

## Features

**Public site**
- Browse events as photo cards, with search on the homepage.
- Buy tickets by quantity against `total_tickets` / `tickets_sold` — the app won't
  let you buy more tickets than remain. A sold-out event can't even be selected in
  the first place: its "Buy Tickets" button on the homepage becomes a disabled "Sold
  Out" button, and its option in the event dropdown is disabled too, not just
  rejected after you try.
- **`payment.php`** — a two-step simulated checkout (review → confirm) supporting
  either card details or FPX bank transfer, with server-side validation branching on
  the selected payment method.
- **Assigned seating for events that need it.** An event can optionally have
  `has_seating` turned on with a rows × seats-per-row layout (`seat_select.php`) —
  buyers click their exact seats on a live map (taken seats are greyed out) instead
  of just picking a quantity. Booking a seat is concurrency-safe (`SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE` on the chosen seat rows inside a transaction), so two buyers can't land the
  same seat in a race. Events without seating keep the original quantity-based flow.
- **QR ticket + check-in.** After a successful payment, every ticket purchased (one
  per seat, or one per unit for quantity-based events) gets its own QR code on the
  confirmation page (rendered client-side, no external service call — see
  `assets/js/qrcode.js`). The QR encodes a long random token, **not** the attendee's
  name/email, so a photographed or glimpsed QR code can't leak personal info; admin's
  `admin/checkin.php` looks up the attendee/event/seat from that token and marks the
  ticket present, safely idempotent if scanned twice.
- "My Orders" on the homepage, with edit/cancel for your own orders and a "View
  Tickets" link back to the QR codes. Editing quantity is disabled for seated-event
  orders (cancel and rebook instead, since a specific seat can't be reassigned by
  just changing a number).
- Register/login/logout, account page, dark/light mode, password visibility toggle,
  TARUMT faculty dropdown at registration.
- Contact form and testimonials (reviews), both moderated by admin.

**Admin panel** (`admin/`, gated by an `is_admin` flag — admins land directly on
`admin/events.php`, never the public site)
- Full CRUD for events: name, date, venue, ticket price, total tickets, photo.
  Event date cannot be set in the past, and total tickets can't be reduced below
  what's already sold. Optionally toggle assigned seating (rows × seats per row) at
  creation time — the seat map is generated immediately and can't be changed
  afterwards (only the event's other details stay editable).
- View/cancel any user's order, and see how many of each order's tickets have been
  checked in.
- **`admin/checkin.php`** — paste or scan a ticket's QR token to look up the
  attendee, event, and seat, then mark them present. Re-scanning an already-checked-in
  ticket shows the original check-in time instead of a second "Mark Present" button.
- Moderate testimonials and view contact messages.
- Manage user accounts: promote/demote admin access, delete an account (cascades — deleting a user also deletes all of their bookings/orders/tickets and testimonials in the same transaction, so there's nothing left over to clean up manually), or create a brand-new admin account directly (`admin/user_create.php`) without needing that person to self-register first. An admin can never delete or demote their own account.

There's deliberately **no admin dashboard** (`admin/index.php`) and no notification
system — those are left as exercises using the same query/render patterns as the
other admin pages.

## Tech stack

Plain procedural PHP (no framework) + MySQL via `mysqli`. All queries use prepared
statements and all output is escaped with `htmlspecialchars()` — these are safe
patterns to reuse elsewhere in your project.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.x with the `mysqli` extension
- MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB / Amazon RDS (MySQL-compatible)
- A web server (Apache/Nginx) or just `php -S` for local testing

## Quick start (local)

1. Create the database and import the schema (this also seeds an admin account and
   six sample events — three general-admission, three with assigned seating — each
   with a real seat map generated automatically):
   ```
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE event_ticketing_db"
   mysql -u root -p event_ticketing_db < schema.sql
   ```
2. Point `config.php` at your MySQL instance — either edit the fallback values
   directly, or export environment variables before starting PHP:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost DB_USER=root DB_PASS=yourpassword DB_NAME=event_ticketing_db
   ```
3. Serve the folder, e.g.:
   ```
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000/` for the public site, or log in with the seeded
   admin account below to reach the admin panel.

## Default admin login

```
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: admin123
```

**Change this password (or the seed row in `schema.sql`) before deploying anywhere
beyond a local demo** — it's a well-known credential once this code is shared.
Regular users register their own accounts via the Register page.

## Project structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `schema.sql` | Creates the database, all tables, and seed data |
| `config.php` | Database connection — reads `DB_HOST`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASS`/`DB_NAME`, plus S3 photo storage config |
| `healthz.php` | ALB health check target — `200` if the DB connection works, `500` otherwise |
| `auth.php` | Session helpers: `current_user_id()`, `require_login()`, `require_admin()`, etc. |
| `helpers.php` | Image upload/delete helpers, faculty list, entity image URL resolver |
| `register.php` / `login.php` / `logout.php` | Account creation and session login (passwords hashed, never plaintext) |
| `index.php` | Public landing page — event cards + "My Orders" |
| `create.php` / `edit.php` / `delete.php` | Order CRUD, requires login + ownership |
| `seat_select.php` | Seat-map picker for events with `has_seating = 1` |
| `payment.php` | Simulated checkout (card or FPX); creates one `tickets` row (with QR token) per seat/unit purchased |
| `confirmation.php` | Order receipt + one QR code per ticket |
| `events.php`, `about.php`, `contact.php`, `testimonials.php` | Public informational pages |
| `partials/header.php` / `partials/footer.php` | Shared navbar/footer, included by every page |
| `admin/` | Admin-only CRUD for events, orders, testimonials, messages, users, plus `admin/checkin.php` for QR ticket check-in |
| `assets/js/qrcode.js` | Vendored client-side QR code generator ([kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator), MIT) — no external network calls at runtime |
| `uploads/` | Uploaded event photos |
| `style.css` | Shared styling (navbar, cards, forms, tables, seat map, tickets, dark/light mode) |

## Event photos: local disk by default, S3 already wired up (just needs your bucket)

Uploads are validated with `getimagesize()` (not just the file extension) and capped
at 5MB. Where they're stored depends on `AWS_S3_BUCKET` in `config.php`:
- **Unset (default)**: saved into `uploads/`, `events.image_url` stores a path like
  `/uploads/event_xxx.jpg`. Nothing to configure.
- **Set**: uploaded to that S3 bucket instead (hand-written Signature Version 4
  signing over PHP's built-in stream wrapper — no AWS SDK, no Composer), and
  `image_url` stores the full object URL.

**This doesn't move anything already stored.** The demo photos seeded via
`schema.sql` (and any photo uploaded before `AWS_S3_BUCKET` was set) already have a
local `/uploads/...` path saved in the database — switching S3 on only affects the
*next* upload/replace through the admin panel, it doesn't rewrite existing rows.
Migrating those existing local images to S3 isn't built here; that's left as an
exercise.

Credentials are tried two ways: first an IAM role attached to the EC2 instance (via
the metadata service, nothing hardcoded), and if that's not available — e.g. an AWS
Academy Learner Lab where you can't attach or inspect IAM roles yourself — explicit
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`/`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`. Set these in a
`.env` file (copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in the values from the lab's "AWS
Details" panel — `.env` is git-ignored, so it's never committed to this public repo),
or as Apache environment variables if you'd rather not use a file. Those temporary
credentials expire and rotate periodically — if uploads that were working suddenly
fail, refresh them and, if using `.env`, no restart is needed.

This matters once there's more than one EC2 instance behind the ALB — a photo saved to
local disk only exists on whichever instance handled the upload, so any other instance
shows a broken image for it. **What's still on you**: creating the bucket + a public-read
bucket policy (or CloudFront), getting one of the two credential methods above working,
and setting `AWS_S3_BUCKET`/`AWS_S3_REGION`. The signing logic is verified against AWS's
own SigV4 test vectors, the local-disk path is tested live end-to-end, and a signed
request with fake credentials was confirmed to reach a real S3 endpoint and get a
structured `403` back (not a crash/hang) — but a full successful round-trip against a
real bucket with real credentials hasn't been tested, since there wasn't one available
here.

Notes for EC2 deployment:
- `uploads/` needs to be writable by the web server user: `chmod 775 uploads` after
  copying the app to `/var/www/html/`.
- PHP's default `upload_max_filesize` (often 2M) is smaller than the 5MB this app
  allows — bump it in `php.ini`:
  ```
  upload_max_filesize = 10M
  post_max_size = 12M
  ```
  then restart the web server.
- Point your ALB target group's health check at `healthz.php` — it returns `200` only
  if the database connection actually succeeds (`500` otherwise), so a target that
  can't reach RDS gets correctly pulled out of rotation instead of still receiving
  traffic.

## Phase 2: running it on a single EC2 instance

1. **Launch the instance**: EC2 console → Launch Instance → Amazon Linux 2023 AMI,
   `t2.micro`/`t3.micro` (free-tier eligible). Create or select a key pair (download
   the `.pem` if new) — you'll need it to SSH in.
2. **Security group**: allow inbound `SSH (22)` from your IP only, and `HTTP (80)`
   from `0.0.0.0/0` (the assignment's assumptions say HTTPS isn't required for this
   proof of concept). Leave all other ports closed.
3. **Connect via SSH** once the instance is "running" and you have its public IPv4
   address:
   ```
   chmod 400 your-key.pem
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ipv4>
   ```
4. **Install a LAMP stack** on the instance:
   ```
   sudo dnf install -y httpd php php-mysqli mariadb105-server
   sudo systemctl enable --now httpd mariadb
   ```
5. **Copy this folder onto the instance** (run from your local machine, not the SSH
   session):
   ```
   scp -i your-key.pem -r ./event-ticketing ec2-user@<public-ipv4>:/tmp/
   ```
   Then on the instance:
   ```
   sudo cp -r /tmp/event-ticketing/* /var/www/html/
   sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html
   sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/uploads
   ```
6. **Secure MySQL/MariaDB**, create a DB user, then import the schema:
   ```
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
   ```
7. **Point the app at the database**: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set
   `DB_HOST`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASS`/`DB_NAME` there to match your MySQL
   credentials (`config.php` loads `.env` automatically - see the loader at
   the top of the file; `.env` is git-ignored so it's never committed). Or,
   if you'd rather not use a file, edit `config.php` directly, or export the
   same names as Apache environment variables via a `SetEnv` directive in
   `/etc/httpd/conf.d/`.
8. **Test it**: open `http://<public-ipv4>/` in a browser.

## Phase 3: moving the database to RDS

1. Create an RDS MySQL instance in a private subnet (per the assignment's VPC
   design).
2. From an EC2 instance in the same VPC, run `schema.sql` against the RDS endpoint:
   ```
   mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u <user> -p < schema.sql
   ```
3. Set `DB_HOST` (and `DB_USER`/`DB_PASS`/`DB_NAME` if different) on the web server
   to the RDS endpoint — `config.php` does not need to change.
4. Restrict the RDS security group to only accept traffic from the web/app tier's
   security group, on port 3306.

## A note on authentication and the assignment brief

The assignment's own assumptions state the platform "is publicly accessible to
end-users without requiring a user login, registration, or authentication
gateway" — login/registration is **not** required to satisfy the "Functional"
rubric criterion. It's included here because it makes the demo feel like a real
product and is a reasonable "advanced feature" to point to in the Part 2
demonstration. If you'd rather keep things simpler, you can delete `auth.php`,
`register.php`, `login.php`, `logout.php`, the `require_login()` calls, and the
`user_id` column/joins — the CRUD logic underneath is unaffected either way.

## Extending for extra marks

This app covers CRUD, accounts, a baseline admin panel, live ticket inventory, and a
simulated checkout. Ideas for going further:
- An admin dashboard: stats tiles (total revenue, tickets sold, upcoming events)
  plus graphs of revenue and tickets sold over time, broken down per event, so an
  admin can see which events are selling best.
- An order status workflow (pending/paid/refunded) instead of instant-confirm.
- Live chat between a user and admin (not a chatbot — a real-time message thread) for support questions, e.g. a `messages` table keyed by conversation with sender/recipient, polled or long-polled for new messages.
- Cap how many tickets a single account can buy per event (the time-based equivalent of "max 2 hours per account" for a slot-booking app — here it's a max-quantity-per-account limit instead), so one account can't buy up an entire event's inventory.
- Wire event photo uploads to Amazon S3 (see above).
- A REST/JSON API layer for load testing tools (Apache Bench, JMeter, Locust) to hit
  directly.
